AngularJS widget is a widget that can be directly used to draw D3 components without writing the actual D3 code.
The user specifies the type of the D3 visualization in one of the attributes named "chart" of the widget and while loading the widget loads the svg for the user.
The user also specifies the data source using "filepath" attribute from where the D3 pulls the data and draws on to the svg.
